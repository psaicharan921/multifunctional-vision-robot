# multifunctional-vision-robot
Simulated a multifunctional robot integrating object tracking, road sign recognition, leader-follower, and CNN-based self-driving. Developed and trained a CNN for steering control using Udacity simulator and deployed in Webots for real-time navigation.

# ü§ñ Mini-Simulation of Autonomous Multifunctional Mobile Robot Using Machine Vision

This project demonstrates the simulation of a multifunctional autonomous robot that integrates four key computer vision capabilities ‚Äî road sign recognition, object tracking, leader-follower functionality, and CNN-based self-driving ‚Äî within Webots and Udacity simulator environments.

## üì∑ Overview

The robot uses an RGB camera and deep learning for vision-based control. It responds to road signs for navigation, detects and follows moving objects, and uses CNN to steer autonomously in simulation.

### üëá Core Functionalities:
‚úÖ Road Sign Recognition using visual tags  
‚úÖ Object Tracking using bounding box logic  
‚úÖ Leader-Follower formation using front-facing camera  
‚úÖ End-to-end Self-Driving with CNN model trained in Udacity simulator

## üìà CNN Training Workflow

1. Captured 13,074 images using triple-camera simulator setup  
2. Cleaned and reduced dataset to 3,505 meaningful training samples  
3. Preprocessed images: cropped, flipped, brightness adjusted, zoomed  
4. Developed CNN with batch normalisation + ELU activation  
5. Achieved <10% loss after 10 epochs without overfitting

## üß† Pseudocode: Object Tracking Decision Logic

```python
if x <= 440:
    # Turn left
elif x >= 640:
    # Turn right
elif area >= 116000:
    # Move backward (object close)
elif area <= 87320:
    # Move forward (object far)
else:
    # Stop
